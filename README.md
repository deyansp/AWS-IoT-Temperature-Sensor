# Overview
This project was part a university assignment and included three different components: low-level driver, userspace application, and a cloud application. 

AWS academy courses were part of the module curriculum, which allowed me to learn about AWS and set up my own LAMP server on and use EC2 and RDBS instances.

A Raspberry Pi was used along with a thermistor to take temperature readings in either Fahrenheit or Celcius depending on the state of an LED. The readings were uploaded to AWS while also using HTTP Basic authentication over HTTPS.
